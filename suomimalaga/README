Suomi-malaga - Voikko edition
=============================

General information
-------------------

Suomi-malaga is a description of Finnish morphology written in Malaga
(http://home.arcor.de/bjoern-beutel/malaga/). You should use malaga
version 7.8 or later.

Currently Suomi-malaga is used in two different applications: text
indexer Sukija and spellchecker/hyphenator Voikko. Unfortunately it
is not yet possible to use unmodified Suomi-malaga with Voikko. In
order to differentiate between the original Suomi-malaga from Hannu
Väisänen and the "Voikko edition" from Voikko project
"Voikko edition" will have an additional component in its version number
and this notice in README file. So for example stable releases of
"Voikko edition" that have version numbers 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.7.2 etc.
are derived from version 0.7 of the "original edition". Development
versions may have different version numbers to avoid breaking package
managers. New versions of the original Suomi-Malaga are available from
http://joyds1.joensuu.fi/sukija/sukija.html and new versions of
"Voikko edition" from http://voikko.sourceforge.net.

All of the documentation about Finnish morphology is in Finnish (see
README.fi and subdirectory doc). This README contains only build
and usage instructions for distribution packagers.


Build and installation
----------------------

Building Suomi-malaga for Voikko from this package requires
malaga, python and make.
No configuration is required: to build the code, you only need to run
    make voikko
Installation can be done by running
    make voikko-install DESTDIR=/usr/lib/voikko
(Replace /usr/lib/voikko with the directory you want to install the
files to. Installing to ~/.voikko will cause libvoikko to use this
version of Suomi-malaga only for the user who does the installation.)


Supported Make targets
----------------------

- voikko
  Builds the binary files needed by libvoikko.
- voikko-install DESTDIR=/usr/lib/voikko
  Installs the binary files needed by libvoikko to the directory
  specified by DESTDIR. DESTDIR is optional and defaults to
  /usr/lib/voikko
- voikko-preprocessed-l-gzip
  Builds the partial source package that contains only binaries
  and sources that are needed to create custom vocabulary files
  for little endian architectures.
  Note that this package alone does not satisfy the source
  distribution requirements of the GPL. If you distribute it,
  you must make the full source package available as well.
- dist-gzip
  Builds the full source package.
- clean
  Removes all files generated by other targets.
- update-vocabulary
  Updates the XML vocabulary from the nightly snapshot at
  joukahainen.lokalisointi.org. This target requires wget to

Variables for tuning the build process
--------------------------------------

- make voikko, make voikko-preprocessed-l-gzip:
  * MIN_FREQUENCY=n
    Limits the words to be included in the .lex files to the
    specified higher frequency class. Default is 9.
