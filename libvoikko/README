This is libvoikko, library for spellcheckers and hyphenators using Malaga
natural language grammar development tool. The library is written in C.

Currently only Finnish is supported, but the API of the library has been designed
to allow adding support for other languages later. Note however that Malaga is
rather low level tool that requires implementing the whole morphology of a
language as a left associative grammar. Therefore languages that have simple or
even moderately complex morphologies and do not require morphological analysis
in their hyphenators should be implemented using other tools such as Hunspell.

Documentation for using the library can be found from header file voikko.h.

The library needs libmalaga and a version of Suomi-malaga containing a file named
voikko-fi_FI.pro. The file should start with the following line:

info: Voikko-Dictionary-Format: 1

The file voikko-fi_FI.pro and other required files of Suomi-malaga should be placed
under the directory /usr/lib/voikko (this directory can be chosen during compile
time using option --with-dictionary-path).

Under Linux and Mac OS X user may have a personal version of Suomi-malaga under
directory $HOME/.voikko which, if found, will be used instead of the system default.
Under Windows the location of user personal dictionary may be specified using the
Windows registry. The key SOFTWARE\\Voikko\DictionaryPath may be placed under either
HKEY_CURRENT_USER or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and it should contain the full path of the
dictionary directory to use.
