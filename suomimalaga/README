Suomi-malaga - Voikko edition

Suomi-malaga is a description of Finnish morphology written in Malaga
(http://home.arcor.de/bjoern-beutel/malaga/). You should use malaga
version 7.8 or later.

Currently Suomi-malaga is used in two different applications: text
indexer Sukija and spellchecker/hyphenator Voikko. Unfortunately it
is not yet possible to use unmodified Suomi-malaga with Voikko. In
order to differentiate between the original Suomi-malaga from Hannu
Väisänen and the "Voikko edition" from Hunspell-fi project
"Voikko edition" will have an additional component in its version number
and this notice in README file. So for example stable releases of
"Voikko edition" that have version numbers 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.7.2 etc.
are derived from version 0.7 of the "original edition". Development
versions may have different version numbers to avoid breaking package
managers. New versions of the original Suomi-Malaga are available from
http://joyds1.joensuu.fi/sukija/sukija.html and new versions of
"Voikko edition" from http://www.hunspell-fi.org/tiedostot.php

All of the documentation about Finnish morphology is in Finnish (see
LUE.MINUT and subdirectory ohjeet). This README contains only build
and usage instructions for distribution packagers.

Building Suomi-malaga for Voikko from this package requires
malaga and make.
No configuration is required: to build the code, you only need to run
    make voikko
Installation can be done by running
    make voikko-install DESTDIR=/usr/lib/voikko
(Replace /usr/lib/voikko with the directory you want to install the
files to. Installing to ~/.voikko will cause libvoikko to use this
version of Suomi-malaga only for the user who does the installation.)
