Suomi-malaga is a description of Finnish morphology written in Malaga
(http://home.arcor.de/bjoern-beutel/malaga/). You need malaga version
6.16 that does not use UTF-8 character set.


All other documentation is in Finnish in file LUE.MINUT and in
subdirectory ohjeet. This is because if you do not know Finnish
you probably are not interested in this program.
