This is libvoikko, library for spellcheckers and hyphenators using Malaga
natural language grammar development tool. The library is written in C.

Currently only Finnish is supported, but adding support for other languages
should not be too hard.

Documentation for using the library can be found from voikko.h. The library
needs libmalaga and suitable Malaga project file. The latter should be placed
in /usr/lib/voikko/suomi.pro (this directory can be chosen during compile
time). If user has a personal Malaga project file in $HOME/.voikko/suomi.pro
that will be used instead.
