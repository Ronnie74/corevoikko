Suomi-malaga - Voikko edition

Suomi-malaga is a description of Finnish morphology written in Malaga
(http://home.arcor.de/bjoern-beutel/malaga/). You need malaga version
7.4.

Currently Suomi-malaga is used in two different applications: text
indexer Sukija and spellchecker/hyphenator Voikko. Unfortunately it
is not yet possible to use unmodified Suomi-malaga with Voikko. In
order to differentiate between the original Suomi-malaga from Hannu
Väisänen and the "Voikko edition" from Hunspell-fi project
"Voikko edition" will have an additional component in its version number
and this notice in README file. So for example stable releases of
"Voikko edition" that have version numbers 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.7.2 etc.
are derived from version 0.7 of the "original edition". Development
versions may have different version numbers to avoid breaking package
managers. New versions of the original Suomi-Malaga are available from
http://joyds1.joensuu.fi/sukija/sukija.html and new versions of
"Voikko edition" from http://www.hunspell-fi.org/tiedostot.php

All of the documentation about Finnish morphology is in Finnish (see
LUE.MINUT and subdirectory ohjeet). This README contains only build
and usage instructions for distribution packagers.

Building Suomi-malaga for Voikko from this package does not require
anything else than malaga and make. No configuration is required:
you only need to run
  make
in this directory and ship all files ending with _l or _b and suomi.pro
with your application. With Voikko this typically means placing the files
in /usr/lib/voikko or ~/.voikko if you do not want to touch the shared
version.
