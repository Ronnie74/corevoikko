This is libvoikko, library for spellcheckers and hyphenators using Malaga
natural language grammar development tool. The library is written in C.

Currently only Finnish is supported, but the API of the library has been designed
to allow adding support for other languages later. Note however that Malaga is
rather low level tool that requires implementing the whole morphology of a
language as a left associative grammar. Therefore languages that have simple or
even moderately complex morphologies and do not require morphological analysis
in their hyphenators should be implemented using other tools such as Hunspell.

Documentation for using the library can be found from header file voikko.h.

The library needs libmalaga and a version of Suomi-malaga containing a file named
voikko-fi_FI.pro. The file should start with the following line:

info: Voikko-Dictionary-Format: 1


Search order for dictionary files
=================================

Upon initialization libvoikko will search for file voikko-fi_FI.pro. Once this
file is found, it will check whether the file is a valid Malaga project file for
Voikko dictionary, and that all required additional files are present. If
voikko-fi_FI.pro turns out to be invalid, it has a wrong version or some required
files are missing or corrupt, initialization will fail with an error and no
additional directories will be checked.

The search is done in the following order:

1) Path given as the last argument to voikko_init_with_path, if that function is
   used to initialize the library.
2) Path specified by the environment variable VOIKKO_DICTIONARY_PATH, if the
   variable is set in the environment of the process initializing the library.
3) Only on platforms with Unix home directories (Linux, BSD and Mac OS X):
   from directory $HOME/.voikko.
4) Only on Windows: Directory specified by the registry key
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Voikko\DictionaryPath.
5) Only on Windows: Directory specified by the registry key
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Voikko\DictionaryPath.
6) Path specified at compile time using --with-dictionary-path (this defaults to
   /usr/lib/voikko).
